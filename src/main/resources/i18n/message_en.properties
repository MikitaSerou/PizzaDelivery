p1=It is still difficult to pinpoint the moment when pizza became famous and popular outside of Italy. However, the fact that the Neapolitans invented it is indisputable. It's hard to imagine that in ancient times, pizza was just a thick dough with a thick layer of tomato sauce. Over the decades, pizza has evolved to become a thin yeast dough pie with different fillings.
p2=Pizza is perhaps the most famous dish in Italian cuisine. Even in the most remote corners of our planet from Italy, it is rare to meet a person who has not tasted pizza at least once in his life. Pizza comes from Naples (the very city of 'millionaires'), it was there that it was first seasoned with tomatoes, and later with other seasonings that later became classic.
p3=This is how a dish appeared, which is perfect from the point of view of all five human senses: the eyes rejoice at the sight of a stunning combination of white mozzarella cheese, red tomatoes and basil greens, the ear delights the crackling of brushwood in the oven, the smell, well, it's not even worth talking about the smell - few people can resist the aroma of pizza, the taste is a variety for all ages and eating habits, and when you take the first bite with your fingers and send it into your mouth with a good sip of wine, what more can you ask for from life?
p4=The name 'pizza' is now found in many cuisines and people even doubt its (word) origin. Now we will introduce you to the history of pizza.
p5=Pizza is a very ancient type of food. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans ate dishes that resemble pizza in their ingredients and method of preparation. In short, pizza appeared as food in the countries along the Mediterranean coast. But it was only in Naples that pizza found its homeland and began its conquest of the rest of the world.
p6=In the 18th century, there was a 'transformation' of flat bread into pizza proper, when tomatoes had their say. Imported from Peru, they have long been considered poisonous. Pizza was originally the food of sailors. Waiting for their return from the night fishing, the bakers prepared pizza at dawn. The classic Marinara pizza is a pizza with fresh tomatoes, anchovies, olive oil and garlic, lightly flavored with oregano. The pizza was baked in the oven and sold right on the street, and the pizza delivery guys were very loud young Neapolitans who delivered their goods directly to the consumer's hands. Pizza was eaten on the street, at home, and finally, what we call a 'pizzeria' today emerged: a hearth, a marble bench on which pizza is prepared, a shelf with spices, tables for visitors, a showcase with pizza for sale (what you can take away with you) - all this we find in modern pizzerias, little has changed over the past centuries.
